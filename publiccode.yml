    longDescription: >
      DSS (Digital Signature Services) is an open-source software library for electronic signature creation and validation. 
      DSS supports the creation and verification of interoperable and secure electronic signatures in line with European 
      legislation. In particular, DSS aims to follow the eIDAS Regulation and related standards closely. 
      
      DSS can be re-used in an IT solution for electronic signatures to ensure that signatures are created and verified in
      line with European legislation and standards. DSS allows re-use in a variety of different ways: in an applet, in a
      standalone application or in a server application. DSS can also be used as a reference implementation for IT
      solutions which do not directly re-use it. Demos are also available to assist the use of DSS as a reference
      implementation.
      
      The project is written in Java and issued under LGPL 2.1, a non-viral open source license.
